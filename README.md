# TASK TRACKER

This app lists and creates tasks. 

The frontend is built with React and is located in the task-tracker-fe directory, while the API is built with Ruby on Rails and SQLite, located in the task-tracker-api directory. 

**Each directory contains a README with instructions on how to run the frontend and backend.**

Some reasons this app is found in a monorepository are:
- It is a simple app so backend and frontend do not require full teams working independently in different repositories
- The app in this moment is small and is just starting so functionality is crucial over deployment resources (in this stage - like an MVP)
- It is expected to not grow a lot yet
- It is a small app so there's not need to implement two different deployments
